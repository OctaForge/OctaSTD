Additionally some code from the libc++ project has been used as a reference;
libc++ is a part of the LLVM project.

The libutf project (https://github.com/cls/libutf) was used as an inspiration
for some of the Unicode implementation bits within libostd and the gen\_unicode
program used to generate the necessary ctype tables, but all of the code was
written from scratch; nevertheless, I would like to give some credit and thanks
to the project here.

Additional thanks to Dale Weiler aka graphitemaster (reference code in the
Neothyne project) and cppreference.com.
